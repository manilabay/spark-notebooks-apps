# spark-notebooks-apps

This repo is to refresh the author's Spark knowledge, to play a little bit again with it and hit an interview process with more chances, it could be useful for people learning Spark programming as well. Cross the fingers and wish him good luck ;)

It will be an exercise to create and run simple Apps using Scala(with sbt), Python(with pip), Java(with maven), SQL, Parquet.

Spark programming ELI5 (Explain me Like I´m 5): You must think about it as an extra layer to do your programmer life easier. Basically Spark programming is a chain of dots with instructions(aggregates, transformations, filters, etc) and every dot represent an input and output in a long data pipeline. Also you can extend your Spark programming using the typical objects and functions in every programming language with focus in data capabilities, for example in python it is common to develop Spark Apps using Python numpy and pandas library.

## Dependencies

* Spark
* Scala + [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)
* Python 3.x + pip
* Java + maven
